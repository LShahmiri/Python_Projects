### Bagels:

     you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.

### Stone-Paper-Scissor:

    it is the traditional game.  it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play stone will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("stone crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers stone"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.  
### working_File-Folders:

    a simple code about how we can move files in their Corresponding folders


### Game of Craps in Python
Rules of the game:

    Two dices are required to play and a player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.
    If on the first roll a player encounters a total of 7 or 11 the player automatically wins, and if the player rolls a total of 2, 3, or 12 the player automatically loses, and play is over.
    If a player rolls a total of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on their first roll, that number becomes the ‘point. Then the player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things happens either they roll the ‘point’ again, in which case they win, or they roll a 7, in which case they lose.
    
### Number Guessing

      This  Python project is a  game that generates a random number that the user must guess after receiving hints. For each wrong guess the user makes, they receive extra hints, but at the cost of reducing their final score.
      
### To-Do List
      Create a program that allows a user to add and remove tasks from a to-do list. The program should keep track of the tasks in a list.
      
### Grocery List
      Create a program that allows a user to add and remove items from a grocery list. The program should keep track of the items in a list.
      
### Hangman Game
      Create a hangman game that randomly selects a word from a list and allows the player to guess letters until they either solve the word or run out of guesses.
