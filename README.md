### Stone-Paper-Scissor:
it is the traditional game.  it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win or a loss. A player who decides to play stone will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("stone crushes scissors" or "breaks scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers stone"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.

### Game of Craps in Python
Rules of the game:

    Two dices are required to play and a player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the numbers rolled together.
    If on the first roll a player encounters a total of 7 or 11 the player automatically wins, and if the player rolls a total of 2, 3, or 12 the player automatically loses, and play is over.
    If a player rolls a total of 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on their first roll, that number becomes the ‘point. Then the player continues to roll the two dice again until one of two things happens either they roll the ‘point’ again, in which case they win, or they roll a 7, in which case they lose.
